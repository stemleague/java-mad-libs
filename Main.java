    // Part 1: Defining Input Variables 
    //Let's define some variables you may want to use below, in Mad Libs we want to work with INPUTS in this game,
    //so we want to declare a variable to an input. We can do this by writing:
    String myNumber = "5";
    System.out.println("This is the number you typed in " + myNumber);
    System.out.println("Hello world!");


    // Part 2: Walk Through an Example Mad Lib 
    // Alright now, we have some variables, let's write print statements that we want
    // to print out from our Mad Libs. Keep in mind we will be concatenating (adding) our
    // variables together.
    // Try making some variables you want to use in your Mad Libs program and make sure to add an 
    // input() function that takes in the prompt to ask the user.
    // Here's an example below:
    String adjective = ""; // TODO: Add adjective here
    String adjective2 = ""; // TODO: Add adjective here
    String room_in_a_house = ""; // // TODO: Add room here
    System.out.println("It was a " + adjective + ", cold November day. I woke up to the " + adjective2 + " smell of roasting in the " + room_in_a_house + " downstairs.");
    System.out.println(); // empty line
    
    
    // Part 3: Making your own Mad Libs
    // Now it is time for your to go on & make your own Mad Libs! Be creative & fun :) 
    // Feel free to use the example from above for some inspiration!
    System.out.println("Let's start writing your own Mad Libs below! :)");
    
  }
